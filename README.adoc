My configuration for {Starship}, the minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell!

== Usage

This repository contains the configuration files for {Starship}, which I use for both {fish} and {Nushell}.
This file is synchronized using this Git repository.
The following instructions detail how to use and sync this repository.

=== Prerequisites

{Nerd-Fonts} are required for this configuration.
I use the patched {Noto} fonts.
Noto Sans is the default font used in {Fedora} Linux.
Follow these steps to install the patched Noto fonts.

. Create the `~/.local/share/fonts` directory.
+
[,sh]
----
mkdir --parents ~/.local/share/fonts
----

. Download the Noto fonts tarball.
+
[,sh]
----
curl --fail --location --remote-name https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.1.1/Noto.tar.xz
----

. Extract the tarball's contents to the fonts directory.
+
[,sh]
----
tar --directory ~/.local/share/fonts -xf Noto.tar.xz
----

. Clean up the lingering tarball.
+
[,sh]
----
rm Noto.tar.xz
---- 

=== Install

Install these settings with the following instructions.

. Add the `starship` COPR repository to your system.
+
[,sh]
----
curl -L https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/starship/repo/fedora/atim-starship-fedora.repo \
  | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/atim-starship-fedora.repo
----

. Install the `starship` package.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo rpm-ostree install starship
----

. Reboot to complete the installation.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo systemctl reboot
----

. Clone this repository.
+
[,sh]
----
git -C ~/Projects clone git@github.com:jwillikers/starship-config.git
----

. Copy the configuration file to the `~/.config/` directory.
+
[,sh]
----
ln --relative --symbolic --force ~/Projects/starship-config/starship.toml ~/.config/
----

. Follow the install instructions in the https://github.com/jwillikers/fish-config[fish config repository] and https://github.com/jwillikers/nushell-config[Nushell config repository] to enable Starship.
